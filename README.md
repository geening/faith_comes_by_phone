# Faith Comes by Phone
####A low-tech call-service to reach some of the poorest and most marginalized people groups with the gospel.  
While missionaries have done an astonishing job translating the Bible, literacy rates remain low in developing reagions of the world (rendering a printed gospel inert).  Morover, these groups are often given Bibles in the nearest 'trade language', instead of the language they speak fluently.  Using audio from [Bible.is](http://www.bible.is/) and the [Digital Bible Platform](http://www.digitalbibleplatform.com/), this service will allow these groups to listen to the Bible in their native language, for as long as they like, for free. The service **does not require a smartphone**, and can be **controlled by SMS messaging**.


### How does it work?
**Phone Numbers:** Churches and missionaries can distribute phone numbers to families without Internet or smartphone access.  Each phone number represents a single country and language.  

**Calling:**
When a user calls or texts the number, the service calls back and plays the audio (incomming calls are free). When a user hangs up, we 'bookmark' their spot for next time (based on their phone number). 

**Texting:**
__When a user texts a verse_ (Example: Romans:8) the service imediatly calls the user and plays that verse.  
_If a user texts a question mark_ the service returns a text based menu of the user's recent play-history.
